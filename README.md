Apple II - 2048
=======

Apple II 2048 Game - based on the engine from Carlos Duarte do Nascimento (Chester)'s 2048 game for the Atari 2600: https://github.com/chesterbr/2048-2600

It is starting out as the rawest of raw ports, with just a text UI that can run on both Apple II and Apple /// computers and emulators.

Gameplay
--------
The spacebar resets the game at any time and starts over.  Arrow keys shift the board.  A high scrore is kept as games progress.  Each value displayed in the grid can be interpreted as 2^n where 'n' is the value being displayed.  The goal is to get to 11, or 2^11 = 2048!
