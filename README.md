AII2048
=======

Apple II 2048 Game - based on the engine from Carlos Duarte do Nascimento (Chester)'s 2048 game for the Atari 2600: https://github.com/chesterbr/2048-2600

It is starting out as the rawest of raw ports, with just a text UI that can run on both Apple II and Apple /// computers and emulators.
